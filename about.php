                    <h4>Here is a short history about bows and arrows</h4>
                    <p>
                        The bow and arrows are, of course, one of the most ingenious inventions of human species. From the moment the man 
                        learned to make this formidable weapon, his life was marked, irreversibly, by its versatility and efficiency. The man
                        found utility, but also pleasure in archery,becoming, throughout history a hunting tool, a weapon war,sports 
                        equipment,leisure accessory and piece of collection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bow and arrow are an invention that allowed primitive humans to obtain their food by shooting at an animal that 
                        was grazing or that could attack them from a safe distance. An inspired man of the Stone Age invented the bow, 
                        immediately becoming the most effective hunter on earth. The bow consisted of a thin wooden rod that could be bent 
                        and a plant rope, a tendon or other flexible material, well stretched between the ends of the wooden rod.The bow has 
                        a very old history, appearing in cave paintings from 30,000 years ago in caves in Western Europe. Thus, there is 
                        evidence that the bow has been used in both hunting and warfare since the Paleolithic.
                    </p> 
                    <p> The materials used to build the bow and arrow significantly influenced the effectiveness ofthem. Various bones 
                        and types of wood have been used for manufucturing the bow over time. The material had to meet a number of 
                        essential requirements: to be easy to obtain for the manufacturer and to be durable and resilient. The arrows 
                        were made of many materials. Their tops were obtained first from charred wood, then from stone or bone, and 
                        finally from metal.

                        speed and descends to the ground. The arrow is intended to be used at moving targets, in the air or over short 
                        distances. The arrows exist in diameters of 5/16 and 11/32. The arrows are complete and are provided with nock, 
                        natural Flu Flu feathers and tip.
